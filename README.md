Advanced Subdomain Discovery Tool
Overview:-

        The Advanced Subdomain Discovery Tool is a robust and versatile utility designed to uncover subdomains of a target domain using multiple discovery techniques. Whether you're a penetration tester, security researcher, or system administrator, this tool provides the functionalities you need to perform thorough subdomain enumeration and threat analysis.

Features:-

        Brute-Force Subdomains: Utilize a customizable wordlist to brute-force potential subdomains.
        DNS Zone Transfer: Attempt to retrieve the DNS zone information if misconfigured.
        Reverse DNS Lookups: Resolve discovered IP addresses back to domain names to uncover additional subdomains.
        Certificate Transparency Logs: Query certificate transparency logs to find subdomains associated with SSL certificates.
        Custom Domain Discovery: Add and scan custom domains alongside the primary target domain.
        Threat Level Analysis: Conduct basic threat level analysis on discovered subdomains (future versions may include real threat intelligence).
        Multithreading: Use concurrent threads to speed up the brute-forcing process.
        Modular Architecture: Easy to extend with additional subdomain discovery techniques.

Requirements

Python 3.x: Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
Python Packages: Install the required packages using pip:

        Usage
        Command-line Arguments
        Argument	        Description	                                                Required	Default
        -d, --domain	        Target domain for subdomain discovery	                        Yes	        N/A
        -w, --wordlist	        Path to a wordlist file for brute-forcing subdomains	        No	        N/A
        -t, --threads	        Number of threads for brute-forcing	                        No	        10
        -l, --threat-level	Enable threat level analysis for discovered subdomains	        No	        N/A
        --custom-domains	Space-separated list of custom domains to include in discovery	No	        N/A
        --zone-transfer	        Attempt DNS zone transfers for the domain	                No	        N/A
        --reverse-dns	        Perform reverse DNS lookups for discovered subdomains	        No	        N/A


Examples
Basic Subdomain Discovery:

Discover subdomains for example.com using the default settings:

python subdomain_discovery.py -d example.com
Brute-Force with a Custom Wordlist:

Use a custom wordlist for brute-forcing subdomains:

        python subdomain_discovery.py -d example.com -w wordlist.txt
        
Zone Transfer and Reverse DNS:

Attempt a DNS zone transfer and perform reverse DNS lookups:

        python subdomain_discovery.py -d example.com --zone-transfer --reverse-dns

Multiple Domains:

Include additional custom domains in the discovery process:


        python subdomain_discovery.py -d example.com --custom-domains custom1.com custom2.com

Threat Level Analysis:

Enable threat level analysis on the discovered subdomains:


        python subdomain_discovery.py -d example.com -l

Output
The tool will output discovered subdomains directly to the console. If the threat level analysis is enabled, each subdomain will be accompanied by its assessed threat level.

Architecture
The tool is modular, allowing for easy addition of new subdomain discovery techniques. Each discovery method is encapsulated in its own function, which can be independently maintained and tested. The tool currently supports the following discovery techniques:

DNS Zone Transfer: Uses dnspython to attempt a zone transfer from a DNS server.
Brute-Forcing: Uses requests and multithreading to test potential subdomains generated from a wordlist.
Certificate Transparency: Queries crt.sh to retrieve subdomains listed in SSL certificates.
Reverse DNS Lookups: Resolves IP addresses to discover additional subdomains.
Limitations
Threat Level Analysis: The current implementation of threat level analysis is basic and assigns a "Low" threat level to all subdomains. Future versions will integrate with real threat intelligence sources.
DNS Zone Transfer: Successful DNS zone transfers are rare as most DNS servers are configured to disallow such transfers.
